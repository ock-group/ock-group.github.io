Dr. Janghoon Ock is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. He earned his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, where his research focused on AI-driven materials and chemical engineering, emphasizing large language models, multi-agent systems, machine learning force fields, and multimodal integration of simulation and characterization data. His work has been published in *Nature Machine Intelligence*, *ACS Catalysis*, *Journal of Chemical Physics*, and *Nano Letters*. He received his B.S. and M.S. degrees from Seoul National University, South Korea, where he studied the rheological properties of polymeric particulate solutions. Beyond academia, he worked as an Associate Research Scientist at SK Innovation, focusing on high-pressure polymer process simulation and electrode coating. This combination of academic and industry experience provides him with a deep understanding of the lab-to-commercialization process, which he leverages with AI to drive innovation in energy, electronics, and advanced materials.
