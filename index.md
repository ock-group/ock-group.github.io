# AI-Driven Molecular & Materials Design and Discovery  

The **Ock Research Group** at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln develops artificial intelligence and autonomous systems to accelerate molecular and materials innovation. We focus on AI-driven design, autonomous discovery, and scalable modeling approaches to transform how new molecules and materials are created.  



## Highlights
